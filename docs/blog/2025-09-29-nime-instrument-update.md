## Making the controller actually playable (and fun): a small-but-solid update

I took another pass at the instrument and made it feel a lot more like a thing you can just pick up and make music with. Nothing wild, but a handful of intentional changes that add up.

### Why change it at all?

I kept finding myself noodling and wishing I didn’t have to think about “wrong” notes. Also wanted a dead-simple performance gesture that reads visually. So I re-centered around: playable scale on buttons, one physical knob for safety (volume), and a single gestural effect you can lean into.

### The quick summary (what’s new)

- Hardware target is Electrosmith Daisy Seed using DaisyDuino (Arduino framework via PlatformIO).
- 5-note major pentatonic mapped to dedicated buttons for instant consonance.
- Volume pot on A0 with jitter suppression so the mix doesn’t skitter around.
- VL53L0X time-of-flight sensor driving an Overdrive amount (closer = gnarlier).
- Lightweight audio path: per-note sine oscillators → mix → overdrive → master volume.
- Two extra buttons reserved for upcoming controls (toggle/utility), not wired yet.

### Under the hood: what changed, specifically

- Platform & deps (PlatformIO):
  - Env: `electrosmith_daisy` (Arduino + STM32H7)
  - Libraries:
    - DaisyDuino (from electro-smith repo)
    - Adafruit_VL53L0X@^1.2.4 (with Wire)
  - Upload via DFU; USB CDC enabled in build flags.

- Buttons → notes (major pentatonic):
  - I’m using five dedicated “note” buttons with MIDI numbers `[60, 62, 64, 67, 69]` → C, D, E, G, A.
  - Each note gets its own `Oscillator` (sine), pre-initialized at 48kHz sample rate.
  - You can mash multiple buttons; they just sum. I attenuate after mixing to keep headroom.

- Volume that behaves: 
  - Analog read from `A0`.
  - Changes only register when the raw reading moves more than 10 counts (tiny hysteresis).
  - Scaled to 0–0.5 for “you can’t accidentally destroy the PA” safety.
  - Serial prints show a friendly percent so I can see what’s happening while testing.

- Gesture → timbre (distance to distortion):
  - The VL53L0X is running in continuous ranging, polled every 50ms.
  - I ignore tiny changes (<5mm) to reduce zipper noise.
  - Mapping: 50mm → 50% drive, 300mm → 0% drive (closer = harsher). It’s a simple `map(constrain(...))` for now.
  - Only applies the Overdrive when there’s actual signal so the noise floor stays quiet.

### The audio pipeline, simplified

Oscillators (sine per pressed note) → sum → Overdrive (drive set by distance) → master volume (global, with extra attenuation when polychording).

Some details:

- Oscillators are initialized with `SetAmp(1.0f)`, but I multiply the mixed signal by `0.3f * volume` at the end to avoid clipping when stacking notes.
- Overdrive’s `SetDrive` happens inside the audio callback right now (because it’s convenient). This works, but I’ll probably move it to a control-rate update with smoothing to avoid per-sample parameter churn.

### Pins, timing, and other bits I’ll forget if I don’t write them down

- Button pins: `{18, 20, 24, 26, 22, 16, 28}` (5 note buttons + 2 utility).
- Debounce is handled via DaisyDuino’s `Switch` class; I initialize with pull-ups.
- Sensor cadence: 50ms poll interval; only update state when `isRangeComplete()`.
- Sample rate: 48kHz via DaisyDuino; oscillators initialized with that.

### Things that felt good (aka the “oh nice” moments)

- Major pentatonic on hardware buttons is instant gratification. You can’t really step wrong, which invites bolder rhythmic play.
- The distance → drive mapping is super legible on stage (and on video). You can see the gesture and hear the result in the same breath.
- The tiny bit of hysteresis on volume and distance made a bigger difference than I expected. Less wiggle, more control.

### Known weirdness and little paper cuts

- Overdrive drive value updates happen inside the audio loop. It’s fine for now, but I want to move that to a smoothed control stream.
- The two extra buttons are placeholders. One is earmarked for an “effect toggle” (there’s a constant defined), but I haven’t hooked it up.
- Sine-only is musically clean but a bit plain. I’ll add some gentle detune or a second waveform blend soon.

### What I removed (or chose not to add… yet)

- No envelopes per voice. Keeping it organ-like for now. ADSR is tempting but would pull this into proper synth territory.
- No MIDI I/O. Goal here is tactile immediacy; I might add MIDI out later for sequencing external gear.
- No scale switching in code. Committing to one scale (for now) makes the interface simpler.

### Next on deck

- Assign the utility buttons:
  - Toggle Overdrive on/off (quick A/B while performing)
  - Maybe octave shift or a momentary “fifth” latch
- Move parameter updates (volume/distortion) to a control-rate path with smoothing.
- Optional: soft clip/limiter post-mix so I can push oscillator amps a hair without worrying.
- Experiment with waveform mix (sine + a hint of triangle) and very light chorus-style detune.

### If you want to build this exact setup

- PlatformIO `platformio.ini` highlights:
  - `board = electrosmith_daisy`
  - `framework = arduino`
  - `lib_deps` includes DaisyDuino and `Adafruit_VL53L0X@^1.2.4`
  - Upload via `dfu`; build flags enable USB CDC

That’s it for this round. Smaller surface area, better defaults, and a single “show-me” gesture. It’s already more fun to play.
